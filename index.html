            <h2 class="centered">Why</h2>
            <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Sea turtles have been on our planet for millions of years. They have outlived dinosaurs, the ice age, and our human ansestors. They swam in the same oceans as the mighty megladon, and dove beneath the pirate ships that haunted the oceans.
                Sea turtles;the timeless ghosts of the ocean. When you think of a creature like that, you probably think, what can't they outlive. Sadly though, sea turtles have found a new threat;us. Sea turtles have been endangered for the easily changed
                things like lights. Sea turtles use the moonlight to guide them into the ocean but by turning on the lights you guide them the wrong way (which could be a car.) Also the population has been dropping tremendously because of illegal poaching
                and trading. It so sad because sea turtles have been helping this planet for so long by; cutting the seagrass and making sure that the seagrass is at an healthy height. If the sea turtles were not there then the seagrass would die and
                then many animal that live there would die.</p>

            <h2 class="centered">Turtles</h2>
            <p> There are many types of sea turtles such as, Green turtles but, Green, Leatherback, Loggerhead, Hawksbill, Kemp's Ridley, Olive Ridley and Flatback Sea Turtles, are the only species, That are not extinct yet. Many have been hurt like in
                <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/06/sea-turtle-stepped-on-for-selfies-injured-rehabilitation-lebanon-beach/">this article</a>.
                <br /> Sea turtles have been on this planet for 65 million years (near the time of dinosaurs) They are the ancestors of this earth, so why don't we treat them with respect. Sea turtles are the animals are the one animals that have always
                been ignored, Even though they have done so much for us. Sea turtles, were thought to hold the world on their backs and if sea turtles were to be extinct the world would end. Which I believe is true,not in the extreme way where the world
                would blow up. In the way that the ecosystem and us will become weak.</p>
            <h2 class="centered">Solutions</h2>
            </p> Since sea turtles help us in so many ways, we should help them and these are a few ways to help.
            <br /> 1. Unnecessary lighting (like flashlights and camera flashes etc.)
            <br /> The reason why is because Sea turtles use moonlight reflecting off the ocean to guide them there, but when other people turn on their lights at night it could lead them into different and dangerous places. Like sewers and roads,another
            thing is.
            <br /> 2. Reduce the Amount of Chemicals You Use.
            <br /> The chemicals you use on your lawn and in your home can actually wash into the coastal waters – killing plants and animals. It is very important to properly dispose of toxic chemicals and, even better, find alternative products such
            as biodegradable solutions.Also in a study taken in Portland Oregon showed that the wild salmon are swimming with dozens of synthetic chemicals in their systems.
            <br /> 3. Reduce the amount the amount of trash or garbage you use.
            <br /> Not only are you killing the environment but also when sea turtles eat things like plastic or other pieces of trash they can cause impaction, The sea turtle would then float up to the top and then could get run over by boat’s or ships.
            “Any type of foreign object can get stuck in their digestive tract and cause major issues such as an impaction. An impaction causes the turtles to float and they're unable to dive for their food. “ our friends at the turtle hospital have told
            us.”Any type of foreign object can get stuck in their digestive tract and cause major issues such as an impaction. An impaction causes the turtles to float and they're unable to dive for their food.“
